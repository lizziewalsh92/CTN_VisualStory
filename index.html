		<h1>It's Raining Cats and Dogs—and Dog Bites</h1>
		<h3>After years of unchecked backyard breeding, the city is now banning the sale of animals in pet shops. Will this lead to a decrease in dog bites? </h3>

			In a bid to crack down on animal mistreatment and overpopulation, the New York City Council has passed a <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6830039&GUID=07B81FA3-8978-4DEE-8846-3F546DDBB570&Options=&Search=." target="blank">bill prohibiting the sale of animals in pet shops.</a> 
			The ban on “backyard breeding” passed in a 40-5 vote on Nov. 21 and will forbid the harmful practice of breeding and selling animals across the five boroughs.</span>
			<br>
			<br>
			<span class="quote">"This has come 40 years too late, and there’s so much more to be done,"</span>

			Spayed and neutered animals are <a href=" https://www.brown.edu/Research/Colwill_Lab/CBP/spaynueter.htm#:~:text=Spayed%20and%20neutered%20pets%20are%20less%20likely%20to%20bite.%20Unaltered%20animals%20often%20exhibit%20more%20behavior%20and%20temperament%20problems%20than%20those%20that%20have%20been%20spayed%20or%20neutered." target="blank">less likely to bite </a>and help prevent animal overpopulation by stopping unwanted pregnancies in animals. 
			However, dog breeders may choose not to spay or neuter their dogs so that they can continue to breed and sell their animals.
			<br>
			<br>
			In a data analysis of dog bites reported in Brooklyn, reports climbed <span class="bold">69%</span> between 2015 and 2022. 
			This points to a potential uptick in dog breeding in Brooklyn between these years.
			<br>
			<br>
			In both years, <span class="bold">about 89%</span> of dog bites were from dogs who have not been spayed or neutered, which points to a correlation between unfixed dogs who are potentially a product of backyard breeding and amount of dog bites in the borough.
			<br>
			Theresa Samsingh says that she believes that dog bites would decrease if we were to implement mandatory spay/neuter legislation, and that the ban on backyard breeding should also cause a decrease in reported bites.</p>
