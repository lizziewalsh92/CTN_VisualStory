New City Council Bill Mandates “Adopt, Don’t Shop” Policy, But Leaves The Rest To Volunteers


In a bid to crack down on animal mistreatment and overpopulation, the New York City Council has passed a bill prohibiting the sale of animals in pet shops. The ban on “backyard breeding” passed in a 40-5 vote on Nov. 21 and will forbid the practice of breeding and selling animals across the five boroughs.

“This has come 40 years too late, and there’s so much more to be done,” says Theresa Samsingh, 59, the founder of For Animals, a Queens-based cat shelter.

If signed into law by Mayor Eric Adams, the bill will bar the sale of all animals from homes or pet stores and slap offenders with  $500-per-animal fines,starting Dec. 15. Animal rights advocates say this a key step toward alleviating the post-pandemic strain on animal shelters in New York City, where a new animal shelter in Queens reached 200% capacity in less than a month after it opened in July. 

Mandating that residents “adopt, don’t shop” only addresses one part of the broader animal welfare issues in the city. Expensive spay and neuter operations, underfunded animal shelters, and hard-to-come-by treatments for transmissible animal diseases are also to blame for the skyrocketing pressure on shelters and animal owners in recent years.

Animal shelters and their volunteers have been advocating for such laws for decades, Samsingh said. The 59-year-old South Jamaica woman has run a cat rescue from her garage since 2001, and boasts that her 11-person team has rescued more cats than any other organization in the five boroughs. Samsingh is one of the few financiallly fortunate enough to receive funding from her former husband to build and operate her backyard shelter, but most shelter organizations lack space to house animals. 

The Animal Care Centers of NYC is the only animal shelter organization funded by the city, and their facilities have been at critical capacity for years. All other shelters must raise funds on their own to save the city’s companion animals. Local organizations like Brooklyn-based Whiskers-A-Go-Go do what they can to rescue, TNR (trap, neuter, and release), and adopt out cats surrendered by owners or found on the street. 

Eva Prokop of Whiskers-A-Go-Go, a North Brooklyn-based cat rescue, relies on volunteers  to foster animals waiting to be adopted. Recently, she says she has seen a change in the kind of cats found on the street.

“We observed that while in the past, most outdoor cats we TNR’d were feral,” Prokop said, using the acronym for “trap, neuter, return.” “In recent years, they are more often than not friendly cats that used to be pets and were abandoned.”

The uptick in friendly cats found on city streets points to a troubling trend in animal dumping after a brief pandemic surge in animal adoptions took some pressure off shelters. Now, as people return to their offices and no longer have time to care for their pets, organizations like Whiskers-A-Go-Go have had to take on more than they can handle without additional funding.

Chelsea Pickett, who has fostered cats 66 times and volunteered for  Whiskers-A-Go-Go since 2018, has helped socialize feral cats around humans so they find homes. 

“If you have the space, we need you. We also need [widespread] TNR of all animals—one cat equals 45 kittens over the course of their life if they are not fixed,” says Pickett, 30, a Ridgewood resident currently caring for three cats.

Affordable spay and neuter operations are hard to come by. Most private clinics charge between $250 and $500 per operation, according to a Rover study conducted by the ASPCA and other shelters. Samsingh says she has seen some clinics charge as much as $1,000 for a single operation.

“Most of these clinics are private, so operation prices cannot be mandated by the city,” Samsingh says. “But the ASPCA could really help. I see their [mobile clinics] parked on the street, closed, useless.”

Before the pandemic, the ASPCA operated mobile spay-and-neuter services around the city. The service has since been suspended, requiring pet owners to join waitlists and complete same-day eligibility surveys. Locations, often hours away, are revealed only after approval, creating a significant hurdle for full-time workers.

Founded 158 years ago to address the mistreatment of horses in Central Park, the ASPCA has faced investigation for hoarding donations and causing unnecessary animal death. With just 2% of its public donations going to pet shelters, the Center for the Environment and Welfare (CEW) found that the ASPCA made $390 million in 2021 and had $575 in assets. The group also had $11 million in offshore Caribbean accounts, and pays 259 of its employees six-figure salaries according to a New York Post investigation. 

Animal shelter organizers argue that those funds could be diverted to local shelters nationwide, providing more facility space and supplementing spay and neuter operation costs for hundreds of thousands of animals and their families. Rescuers like Samsingh say they also wish the city would do more for these local shelters. While banning backyard breeding is an important step, the animal rescue system still lacks financial support and legislation to keep their community efforts going.

“I don’t know who to call when I have an animal that needs help [that I can’t provide.] I call 311, and they say ‘call the ASPCA’. I call the ASPCA and they say ‘call your local precinct’. The NYPD doesn’t know what to do,” Samsingh says. “There is no concrete avenue to take.”

Community-based organizations continue to focus on TNR, finding homes forfriendly and feral animals and doing the work that the city cannot handle, but volunteers say the pressure is unmanageable without local funding.

“I don’t trap anymore; my bones hurt. It’s so rewarding, but it will destroy your life,” says Samsingh, whose marriage ended, in part, as a result of dedicating her life to rescuing animals on the street.

“They say throwing money at a problem won’t help. But I think, in this situation, throwing money wisely at this problem could solve it.”
